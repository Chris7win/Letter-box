      I don’t know if this is a present to you or not,  
      but definitely for me, it’s a relief.  
      I wanted to say this all to you for long, but I couldn’t.

        Dear friend,  
        This page is just a small way to show what our bond means to me.  
        We might not be speaking right now, but I always value our friendship. 
        <br><br>
        Life’s been moving ahead as it always does, but every now and then, certain silences remind me of the conversations we used to have. The little talks, the random jokes, and even the deeper moments — I remember them all with nothing but genuine fondness.  
        <br><br>
        I won’t lie — I do miss your presence at times. But I’ve also come to understand and respect the space life demands from all of us. People move on, situations change, and that’s just how things are meant to unfold. I’m not here to rewind anything or to expect anything back. I just want you to know this:
<br><br>
        You knew about me everything... You also knew that im not the person who type paras like a esay ... I never did this in my entire life . And also I never wrote a letter to anybody . But Im writing this and making this so called cringe on for my friend (mu)💙
<br><br>
        💫On this day , you got this note ,with that I gave you a chocolate which you like to eat 🍫I never gave you that when you asked it all the time we were together . I thought you will eat that atlast.✨
<br><br>
When you said that don't message or contact me from now onwards on that day , I just said ok. bye that doesnt meant im not missing or being angry on you or doubting our friendship. 

I believe that you also consider this relationship True and me as a friend ,genuinely.

But I nevermind my bad things that happened between us and som bad situation happened for our friendship or some shit gossips on our class about us or on you or on myself.

I never gonna judge you or anyone I think you knew that and knew something about me.

You sometimes you just say that ," un message ku reply panna ma eh irunthurukalam " like for sarcasm , but I never thought that "unkooda pesama irunthurukalam nu". you made me not feel like that , by done something to me.your are the only person who I trusted and seen close to me in college at that time (ippaiyum sollalam). I still remember our first and last talk ! 
𝗘𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗵 𝗻𝗮𝗮 𝘂𝗻 𝗳𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮💯♾️, no matter what.
<br><br>
Mainly I wants to thankyou a lot, you helped me in manyyyy situations by knowing or not. It means alottt to me like writting assignments doing my college works and hearing my rants and even you are main reason behind for passing the last semester(on my compulsion 😂or I don't know) which I'm being afraid to attend the exam time. Yeah you did manythings  to me , I won't forgot that I'll be very grateful for that! Promise!

I don't know that if I could have passed this exam without you. I have to say this , I miss your talks on the result day badly... I want to thankyou for the result mainly ... 

Ella result day la yum 2nd ah patha result unodathu tha antha Mari intha time paaka mattum tha mudinjuthu , 🤧mukkiyama epo naalum seri nee intha results kaaga nee treat veche tha aaganum 😗aah ellam "O" ah potu vechuruka endi? Haan🙂

I don't know that we could read together one more time even this semester and i don't know I would pass this semester exams without you this time even the internals too.
<br><br>
Now, You got to know that you are very mean to me and my life . I think very attached to you and your character!
<br><br>
You are, and always will be, one of the best friends I’ve ever had. No matter how far we drift or how silent the days become, in my eyes, that title remains untouched.

And if there ever comes a time — whether in joy or struggle — when you look around and wonder who’s quietly cheering for you from the sidelines, know that it’s me.  

This isn’t a letter asking for anything. It’s just a note to let you know that your presence once mattered deeply — and still does — but I’m at peace with where things are now.
