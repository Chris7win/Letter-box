    <h1>Happy Birthday My Friend!</h1>
    <p>
      I don’t know if this is a present to you or not,  
      but definitely for me, it’s a relief.  
      I wanted to say this all to you for long, but I couldn’t.

      <p>
        Dear friend,  
        This page is just a small way to show what our bond means to me.  
        We might not be speaking right now, but I always value our friendship.  
        <br><br>
        (You can add as many paragraphs as you like here for testing scroll and long messages)  
        <br><br>
        Friendship doesn’t end when words stop, it lives in memories,  
        in trust, and in the way we know each other.  
        <br><br>
        Even if distance grows, I hope this letter reaches your heart.  
        You’ll always be an important part of my journey.  

        Thank you for being you.

        good friend.

        Friendship is a treasure, and I cherish ours deeply.
        <br><br>
        – From Your Friend
