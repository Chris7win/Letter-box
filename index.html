    <h1>🪐 Happy Birthday My Friend! 🍷</h1>
    <p>
      I don’t know if this is a present to you or not,  
      but definitely for me, it’s a relief.  
      I wanted to say this all to you for long, but I couldn’t.

    <p>Seriously, not for disturbuing you or for talkback or anything, just wanted to say this.</p>

      <p>
        Dear friend,  
        This page is just a small way to show what our bond means to me.  
        We might not be speaking right now, but I always value our friendship. 
        <br><br>
        Life’s been moving ahead as it always does, but every now and then, certain silences remind me of the conversations we used to have. The little talks, the random jokes, and even the deeper moments — I remember them all with nothing but genuine fondness.  
        <br><br>
        I won’t lie — I do miss your presence at times. But I’ve also come to understand and respect the space life demands from all of us. People move on, situations change, and that’s just how things are meant to unfold. I’m not here to rewind anything or to expect anything back. I just want you to know this:

You are, and always will be, one of the best friends I’ve ever had. No matter how far we drift or how silent the days become, in my eyes, that title remains untouched.

And if there ever comes a time — whether in joy or struggle — when you look around and wonder who’s quietly cheering for you from the sidelines, know that it’s me.  

This isn’t a letter asking for anything. It’s just a little note to let you know that your presence once mattered deeply — and still does — but I’m at peace with where things are now.

<br><br>
        Even if distance grows, I hope this letter reaches your heart.  
        You’ll always be an important part of my journey.  

        Thank you for being you.

        good friend.

        Friendship is a treasure, and I cherish ours deeply.
        <br><br>
        <p>Wishing you all the best</p>
        – From Your Friend
